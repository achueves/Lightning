## Invite

The invite is no longer displayed here as Discord's verification requirements have forced the public instance to be semi-private.

---
## Self Hosting

If you want to run your own instance, https://lightning-bot.gitlab.io/config/self-hosting/ contains some general instructions.

---
## Versioning

Lightning is versioned as `major.minor.patch`.

This is similar to SemVer, with a few exceptions.

Major versions are generally expected for project rewrites.

Minor versions are incremented when a command's behavior has changed, functionality has been moved to another cog (where it makes sense to be), a command was removed, etc.

Patch versions are incremented when a bug has been fixed.
